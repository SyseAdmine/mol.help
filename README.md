# mol.help

mol.help is an attemp of a complete rework / refactoring of the LibreOffice Help files.

My goals are:
* a clean and lean data structure inside the help files (code intentation, cleanups)
* consistent wording and naming across all modules
* best user experience in reading the resulting Help (HTML)

For now, first cleanups and improvements are done in folloeing modules:

* schart
* sdraw
* smath

Attention: Cleanups are done without compromises regarding possibly forced retranslation of strings.

I would love to get rid of .xhp and use HTML5 as source and target of translations.

This repo is just a private experiment of mine.

Feel free to contribute or to grab files / changed content for improvements of LibreOffice Help itself.




Any help appreciated.
