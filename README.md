# mol.help

mol.help is an attemp of a complete rework / refactoring of the LibreOffice Help files.

My goals are:
* a clean and lean data structure inside the help files (code intentation, cleanups)
* consistent wording and naming across all modules
* best user experience in reading the resulting Help (HTML)

For now, first cleanups and improvements are done in module 

* smath

We (at LibreOffice)) would love to get rid of .xhp and use HTML5 as source and target of translations.

This repo is a private experiment of mine.

After finishing my initial commits I want to experiment with HUGO and SPHINX.

Any help appreciated.
